Mom is a warm, practical companion for mothers, created and hosted by the hospital they trust. Its purpose is simple: to make pregnancy and the first years of a child’s life clearer, calmer, and safer. When a mother registers at the hospital, Mom begins to walk with her—sending short, friendly messages that say when to come for checkups, what to bring, and why each visit matters. No complicated steps. No heavy reading. Just timely reminders and straightforward guidance that fit real life.

After birth, Mom guides families through the vaccination journey, one appointment at a time, explaining the purpose of each vaccine . If a visit is missed, Mom follows up with care, not judgment—nudging mothers to return and reminding them the hospital is here to help. All this made able through the reminders sent.

Everything is designed for everyday realities: shared phones, limited data, busy schedules, and the weight of caring for a growing family. Every message carries the hospital’s name and number, so mothers know who is speaking and where to go. Mom honors effort and builds confidence. In the end, it’s more than a website—it’s a bridge between mums and timely care, turning health schedules into simple steps, and helping children get protected on time, with steady support.
